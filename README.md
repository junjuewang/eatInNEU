  **Website**: https://junjue.herokuapp.com 

  A website for you to find a place to eat in Northeastern University.

  This is my CS5610 course project. Sometimes it is very difficult for me to pick up the place to eat. So I decided to develop our own website.

  Highlights
  ----------
  <ul>
    <li>Included all the venues around NEU.</li>
  </ul>
  Steps to run locally
  --------------------
  <ul>
   <li>Git clone from master branch. https://github.com/junjuewang/eatInNEU/</li>
   <li>Run "npm install". You might need sudo to run this command. Once node-modules installed successfully, you are ready to go!</li>
   <li>Run "mongod" to start mongodb. For more info about mongodb, please see <a href='http://www.mongodb.org/'>MongoDB</a>.</li>
   <li>Run "npm start" to start the website. You could go to localhost:3000 to check it.</li>
   Note: If you want to use oAuth, please replace the stars in config/secrets.js with your keys.
  </ul>
